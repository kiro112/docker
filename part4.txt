in this part we will learn how to cluster machines


first lets create a new docker-machine virtual host

```
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm2
```

list the create vm
`docker-machine ls`

lets initiate a swarm on myvm1
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>"


then join the myvm2 in the swarm ( you can refer to the response above of vm1 init )
docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm join --token <token> <ip>:<port>"


in the previous cmd we use ssh to remotely execute codes on the vm.
now we will remotely access by changing our *env*

`eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)`
this will change our working station to myvm1


to verify `docker-machine ls` and you will see an asterisk (*) on the active column


`docker node ls`
this will list down the node of the swarm


then deploy an app refer to the part3


you can verify that it is using the nodes by executing
`docker stack ps <stack_name>`
